# Field Matcher

Tag cards that have two (un)equal fields.

## Install

Open [`field_matcher.ankiaddon`](field_matcher.ankiaddon) with Anki.
It's a zip archive created by running:

    zip -j field_matcher.ankiaddon field_matcher/*

## Use

1. In Anki, open `Tools â†’ Match (Un)equal Fields`.
2. Enter the field names, optional search filter, desired match mode, and the tag to apply.
3. Press OK.

### My Use Case

I batch mine cards with Migaku and sort them with AnkiMorphs to get `i+1` sentences.
I keep Migaku's word (because of human audio) and match it to AnkiMorphs's `+1`-lemma:
